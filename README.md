# Hired

A playful SwiftUI simulation of the job application process. Experience a series of status updates as your application is processed, culminating in a celebratory "Hired!" message with confetti.

This project demonstrates:
- **SwiftUI** for a clean, declarative UI
- **Animations** (fade effects, progress bar transitions, confetti, etc.)
- **State management** with SwiftUI's @State properties
- **Sequential status updates** to simulate a real job application process
- **Celebratory visuals** when the process completes

---

## Features

- **Smooth transitions** for a polished user experience
